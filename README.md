###Preamble

AS AN Automotive Sales Manager

I WANT TO periodically update the prices of my inventory

BECAUSE my sales team and customers need to have accurate pricing info

###Story
GIVEN the updated vehicle price is different from the current price by more than five dollars

WHEN I am running the pricing update task

THEN update the vehicles price in the database

// AND print a new tag
